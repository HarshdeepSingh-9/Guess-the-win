there is three game mode in the row , user can pick the game according to choice as well as user can exit the game code and come back to the menu by entering 0 while picking the choice . if the choice has been choosed then there is no way to come back 
# WINNING NUMBERS  
first game is ninning wumbers , i have used concept of choosing numbers and computer will generate a random series of number and will compare the matched numbers , according to the matches numbers your winning will be decided .
